\chapter{Uncertain Network Generator} \label{generator-chapter}

Since most uncertain graphs are more often than not corporate and government assets and sensitive information, they are rarely disclosed to the public. Considering that there are not many publicly available uncertain network datasets, to conduct experiments in following chapters, we put forward a way to generate uncertain networks based on deterministic networks. The way we generate uncertain networks is mainly based on three assumptions: (1) Edges that exist in deterministic networks tend to have high probability in corresponding uncertain networks; (2) In uncertain networks, except existential edges, there should exist some edges which do not exist in deterministic networks, and they tend to have low probability; (3) Based on a power law distribution, nodes with high degree are more likely to have new added edges. Based on these three assumptions, we generated the uncertain network using Algorithm \ref{Uncertain-Network-Generator}. The first loop in Algorithm 4 assigns high probabilities to existing edges (lines 1 to 5). The second loop creates a non existing edge and assign it a low probability (lines 7 to 13). It is worth noting that the percentage of non-existential edges is adjustable (line 6), and we choose different values in different experiments in later chapters.

\begin{algorithm}
  \KwData{A deterministic network $G$, non-existential edge percentage $p$}
  \KwResult{An uncertain network $\mathcal{G}$.}
  \For{each edge $e \in G.edges$}{
        Generate probability $P$ according to a Gaussian distribution with mean 0.8 and variance 0.1. (If not in the range (0,1], regenerate it.)\;
%         \While{probability $P$ not in the range (0,1]}{
%         	Regenerate probability $P$ according to a Gaussian distribution\;
%         }
        Assign probability $P$ to edge $e$\;
        Add edge $e$ to the uncertain network $\mathcal{G}$\;
    }
$NonExistentialEdgesCount\leftarrow|G.edges|\times p$\;
\While{$NonExistentialEdgesCount>0$}{
    Generate edge $e$ which is not in $\mathcal{G}.edges$ based on a power law distribution\;
    Generate probability $P$ according to a Gaussian distribution with mean 0.2 and variance 0.1. (If not in the range (0,1], regenerate it.)\;
%         \While{probability $P$ not in the range (0,1]}{
%         	Regenerate probability $P$ according to a Gaussian distribution\;
%         }
    Assign probability $P$ to edge $e$\;
    Add edge $e$ to the uncertain network $\mathcal{G}$\;
    $NonExistentialEdgesCount \leftarrow NonExistentialEdgesCount-1$\;
}
\Return{uncertain network $\mathcal{G}$}
