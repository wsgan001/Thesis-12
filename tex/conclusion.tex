\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
For the link prediction problem, we propose an uncertain version of graph proximity measures for the link prediction problem in uncertain networks. We propose a new algorithm to reduce the time complexity of computing uncertain version of graph proximity measures. By taking all possible worlds into consideration, the performance of link predictions are improved compared with original and weighted proximity measures.

For the local community detection problem, we provide a novel approach which is able to detect local communities in uncertain networks. By taking the new measure $\mathcal{K}$ into consideration, our algorithm can outperform the other local community detection algorithm based on supervised and unsupervised evaluations.

For the entity ranking problem, we provide a novel approach to deal with edge uncertainty in graph mining problems. Specifically, by taking the inverse of edge probability with a hyper-parameter, we can apply existed graph mining algorithms to problems with uncertainty. We empirically show the effectiveness of our IPG method by experiments. %First, by visualizing the centrality rankings in a dynamic network, we demonstrate IPG's ability to capture salient events underlying the evolution of network. Next, we compare the linear correlation of three method, Negative Logarithm, Most Probable Path, and Inversed Probabilistic Graphs, with sampling. Across a various of datasets and tasks, IPG has a steadily strong linear correlation with sampling compared to the other two. Finally, we compare the performance of the three methods in the previous example on a real dataset with ground truth. We assess the three methods by ROC curves, and results show that IPG still has advantages over NL and ML.
